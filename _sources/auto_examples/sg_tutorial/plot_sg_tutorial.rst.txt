======================================
A quick tour of pytma
======================================

We use the excellent sphinx-gallery to provide a visual tour of some of the
features of pytma. sphinx-gallery renders html from regular python files. We
find this to be much better than Jupyter for documentation of workflows and
example code. We can keep better track of the evolution of the in git this way.



.. code-block:: default


    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt







reStructuredText
----------------

The primary benefit of sphinx-gallery is that it allows you to interweave
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ along with
your regular python code. This means that you can include formatted text
with the script, all using regular text files. rST has a particular structure
it expects in order to render properly (it is what sphinx uses as well).

File headers and naming
-----------------------
Sphinx-gallery files must be initialized with a header like the one above.
It must exist as a part of the triple-quotes docstring at the start of the
file, and tells SG the title of the page. If you wish, you can include text
that comes after the header, which will be rendered as a contextual bit of
information.

In addition, if you want to render a file with sphinx-gallery, it must match
the file naming structure that the gallery is configured to look for. By
default, this is `plot_*.py`.

Interweaving code with text
---------------------------

Sphinx-gallery allows you to interweave code with your text. For example, if
put a few lines of text below...


.. code-block:: default


    N = 1000

    # They will be rendered as regular code. Note that now I am typing in a
    # comment, because we've broken the chain of commented lines above.
    x = np.random.randn(N)

    # If we want to create another formatted block of text, we need to add a line
    # of `#` spanning the whole line below. Like this:







Now we can once again have nicely formatted $t_{e}\chi^t$!


.. code-block:: default


    # Let's create our y-variable so we can make some plots
    y = .2 * x + .4 * np.random.randn(N)







Plotting images
---------------

Sphinx-gallery captures the images generated by matplotlib. This means that
we can plot things as normal, and these images will be grouped with the
text block that the fall underneath. For example, we could plot these two
variables and the image will be shown below:


.. code-block:: default


    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y, 'o')




.. image:: /auto_examples/sg_tutorial/images/sphx_glr_plot_sg_tutorial_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Multiple images
---------------

If we want multiple images, this is easy too. Sphinx-gallery will group
everything together that's within the latest text block.


.. code-block:: default


    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)
    axs[0].hist(x, bins=20)
    axs[1].hist(y, bins=20)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.hist2d(x, y, bins=20)




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-horizontal

      .. image:: /auto_examples/sg_tutorial/images/sphx_glr_plot_sg_tutorial_002.png
            :class: sphx-glr-multi-img

      .. image:: /auto_examples/sg_tutorial/images/sphx_glr_plot_sg_tutorial_003.png
            :class: sphx-glr-multi-img




Other kinds of formatting
-------------------------

Remember, rST can do all kinds of other cool stuff. We can even do things
like add references to other packages and insert images. Check out this
`guide <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_ for
some sample rST code.
